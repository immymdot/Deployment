## Course card 
The course card components display the title, image, and quick description of any available course. The component can be altered in terms of light or dark mode and row or column display. You can embed this component using the builder component. You can find the javascript file for the course card under /src/src/components/Card.js .
## Catalogue 
The catalogue component displays a list of many course cards. This component can also be altered in terms of light or dark mode. You can embed this component using the builder component. You can find the javascript file for the catalogue under /src/src/components/CourseCatalogue.js .
## Builder 
The builder component allows users to select what component they would like to embed and produce they code they need to insert into an HTML file. This is done by allowing users to input dark/light mode and orientation as well as a link (to the course for the course card or to multiple courses for the catalogue). You can find the javascript file for the catalogue under /src/src/components/Builder.js
